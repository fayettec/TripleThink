### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Implement v4.1 completely, not selectively - AI handles complexity
- Logic Layer before API routes - Must build tables/modules before exposing functionality
- 14-phase comprehensive approach - Enables testing at each gate, minimal compression
