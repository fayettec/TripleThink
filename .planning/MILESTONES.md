# Project Milestones: TripleThink

## v4.1 Logic Layer Completion (Shipped: 2026-01-17)

**Delivered:** Complete Logic Layer implementation enabling full story structure tracking (causality, arcs, conflicts, themes, motifs, setups, world rules). TripleThink transforms from a passive tracker into an active "Narrative Operating System" capable of assembling zero-knowledge context packets for scene generation.

**Phases completed:** 1-15 (40 plans total)

**Key accomplishments:**

- Complete Logic Layer Implementation - All 7 logic layer modules operational with full CRUD operations and specialized queries
- Orchestrator Integration - Context assembly system delivers zero-knowledge context packets in 1.76ms (568x faster than target)
- Full-Stack GUI - 13 components + 7 screens wired end-to-end with story logic visualization, narrative editor, epistemic tracking
- Exceptional Performance - State reconstruction 10,000x faster than target, storage 97% under target for 10-book series
- Comprehensive Validation - 106 validation rules across 8 categories running in <1ms
- Complete Documentation - 5,617 lines of user documentation covering all v4.1 features

**Stats:**

- 63 files created/modified
- 18,110 lines of JavaScript/HTML/CSS
- 15 phases, 40 plans, 83 requirements satisfied
- 2 days from first commit to ship (Jan 16-17, 2026)

**Git range:** `eea35b8` (feat(01-01): EVENT_MOMENTS) → `295e9e9` (feat(15-02): relationships endpoint)

**What's next:** v4.2 scope TBD - Address minor tech debt items (mock data, reader view filtering, E2E test fixtures) or begin new feature development
